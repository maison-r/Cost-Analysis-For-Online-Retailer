# Campaign Cost-Benefit Analysis

This project performs a detailed cost-benefit analysis of a marketing campaign using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. The notebook estimates key costs such as email and SMS delivery, design, ad spend, and expected coupon redemptions. It then visualizes these metrics and performs scenario analysis to help stakeholders make informed decisions about campaign investments.
